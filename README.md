This project focuses on analyzing historical Olympic Games data using SQL to uncover insights about athlete performances, medal distributions, and country-wise contributions. The dataset includes detailed records of athletes, their events, and associated medal outcomes across multiple Olympic editions.

* Cleaned and standardized Olympic athlete data by converting age, height, and weight columns to numeric types and formatting medal values to title case.
* Identified and quantified missing values in key attributes to assess data completeness and integrity.
* Analyzed medal counts to determine the top 10 medal-winning countries and their distribution across Summer and Winter Olympics.
* Retrieved the top 5 athletes with the highest medal counts using aggregation and filtering techniques.
* Calculated gold medal ratios to identify countries with the highest proportion of golds among total medals.
* Created dynamic queries to filter medal counts by country and identify athletes who competed in multiple sports.
* Used advanced SQL techniques including window functions and grouping to find the most successful athlete from each country.
* Analyzed event popularity by identifying the top 5 events with the highest athlete participation.
* Joined athlete_events and noc_regions tables to perform region-based medal analysis.
* Retrieved a list of countries that participated in the Olympics but never won a medal using multi-table joins and anti-joins.
